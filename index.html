    <h2>Float Right</h2>

    <p>This demonstration illustrates how an image with its <i>float</i> property set to a value will float to the
        "right" or "left" in the paragraph, meanwhile the text content of our ("p") paragraph tends to wrap about our
        image.</p>

    <p><img src="imgs/land.jpg" alt="land" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
        <b>This text ought to wrap around the image with the image set to the right. </b> Following is just good
        literature that is intended to wrap around the text. First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made a
        Golden Race of mortal men who lived in the time of Kronos when he was reigning in heaven. And they lived like
        gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with
        legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was
        as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them
        fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, rich in
        flocks and loved by the blessed gods. ..." (alternate translation) "And they who were Cronus' day, what time he
        reigned in heaven, lived like gods, no care in heart, remote and free from ills and toils severe, from grievous
        sicknesses and cares; old age lay not upon their limbs, but they, equal in strength of leg and arm, enjoyed
        endless delight of feasting far from ills, and when death came, they sank in it as in a sleep. And many other
        things were theirs; grain-giving earth, unploughed, bore for them fruit abundantly and without stint; and glad
        of heart they dwelt upon their tilth throughout the earth, in midst of blessing manifold, rich in their flocks,
        loved by the blessed gods.
        Stranger : We have often heard the tale of the reign of Kronos . . . And how about the story that the ancient
        folk were earthborn and not begotten of one another?
        Younger Sokrates : That is one of the old tales, too . . .
        Stranger : In the reign of Kronos . . . all the fruits of the earth sprang up of their own accord for men . . .
        god himself was their shepherd, watching over them, just as man, being an animal of different and more divine
        nature than the rest, now tends the lower species of animals. And under his care there were no states, nor did
        men possess wives or children . . . So there were no states or families, but they had fruits in plenty from the
        trees and other plants, which the earth furnished them of its own accord, without help from agriculture. And
        they lived for the most part in the open air, without clothing or bedding; for the climate was tempered for
        their comfort, and the abundant grass that grew up out of the earth furnished them soft couches."
        So if anyone has any similar passages or artwork we can all start to dream these really good and soothing dreams
        perhaps. (p.s. I have tons more suggestions and ideas but don't want to make this post too long).
